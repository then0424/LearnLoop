Our project, LearnLoop, aims to be affordable, sustainable, and personalized for students and tutors. Both students and tutors will benefit from **LearnLoop**. Our function creates a fair ecosystem for students and tutors, in which students can find a desired tutor through traits classification based on comments and ratings from past students. Tutors can increase their credit and popularity by answering questions from students in our built-in forum.

Certain platforms provide direct answers to students during their study process. To some extent, this is convenient, but it is not truly sustainable, as this type of spoon-feeding could eventually destroy students’ capability and retard their potential. Our project aims to take highly voted Q&A and upload materials into a database, then use RAG-LLM to provide guidance, mock tests, and flashcards. Practice and retention through flashcards will be offered using the spaced-repetition method whenever a student fails to answer questions in the mock tests or recalls the answers in flashcards.

Our project also provides personalized progress tracking, where a student can set a target score, and a regression model will analyze the probability of achieving it based on performance in mock tests and feedback from flashcards. This feature encourages students to put in more effort while helping them understand how well they are adapting to a particular subject.

In summary, we are confident that **LearnLoop** will provide a wonderful user experience for both students and tutors in their learning and teaching journey.
